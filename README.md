Contactless Current Sensor projects utilizing CT220 and BM14270AMUV sensor with Tunnel Magnetoresistance and Magneto-Impedance technology respectively. 
There are three main files which are:
1) the Analog CT220 for the analog-to-digital measurement coding using Code Composer Studio
2) the I2C with BM14270AMUV sensor which is a development using Code Composer Studio instead of the library-based code from Arduino.
3) The Arduino code for BM14270AMUV sensor using Arduino Mega 2560.

There are also several documentation to engage more to the current development of these sensors.
